This thesis hypothesises that Buddhist insights can be useful in systems engineering and related disciplines. The thesis commences by arguing that upadana, or a condition of attach- ment can be considered as the root cause of problems in systems engineering. Definitions of attachment from psychology are also discussed in connection to the condition of attachment in Buddhism. Similarities and differences are pointed out.A number of theories, approaches, and frameworks in systems engineering are reviewed and discussed in connection to the condition of attachment. A case study of Secure Electronic Transaction (SET) failures is used to illustrate that the condition of attachment underlies system project failures. This thesis provides the background behind the emergence of SET, a technical overview of it, issues of SET, attempted solutions, and emerging e-payment systems after SET failures.Central to the thesis is the Dhammic framework, a novel theoretical framework grounded in the central tenet of Buddhism that represents states of mind from a Buddhist perspective. This thesis formalises states of mind from Buddhist Dhamma using a formal method in order to avoid ambiguity. The framework is based on chosen doctrines from Buddhist Dhamma and a formal method to logically represent how the reality of a phenomenon is rooted in an individual’s perceptions. Psychological constructs underlying how a condition of attachment is derived, where a condition of attachment is situated, and why a condition of attachment can be undesirable are pointed out. The Dhammic framework can be considered as an iconoclastic framework that is not utilised in existing analytical frameworks for understanding system project failures in the literature, but worth considering in systems engineering.Dhammic TAM (DTAM), which is based on TAM (Technology Acceptance Model) ex- tended by the condition of attachment in Buddhism, is tested using empirical data in order to investigate if the condition of attachment should be considered as a critical construct for predicting behavioural intentions toward using a system. The methodology and the exper- imental results with reference to DTAM are also discussed in the thesis. The results also confirm whether or not the condition of attachment in Buddhism can be useful in systems engineering and related disciplines.The thesis also discusses Majjhima Patipada or the Middle Path (MP), which is an insight for dealing with conflicts in Buddhism. Different MP theories are discussed in reference to modern conflict resolution theories in psychology. Given that the condition of attachment plays an important role in system acceptance, the thesis recommends Buddhist MP systems engineering as an appropriate path for avoding system project failures.
