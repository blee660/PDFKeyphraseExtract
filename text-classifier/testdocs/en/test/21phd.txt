This thesis develops new techniques for segmentation of digital surfaces, based on the active contour concept. A special focus lies on 3D face data; in particular, to what extent 2D feature segmentation methods can be further developed by taking 3D information into account.Two different approaches are pursued:First, a fully 3D model for feature extraction from general surfaces is proposed, that gen- eralises the standard geodesic active contour. It avoids some intrinsic limitations of existing works by employing the implicit, instead of the parametric surface representation. Experi- ments on synthetic and natural surfaces emphasise the significant gain in accuracy.Second, the thesis demonstrates that 2D techniques can be adapted for the segmentation of surface data given in the form of range images. Well-known active contour schemes are incorporated into efficient and accurate algorithms for curvature-based 3D lip contour seg- mentation. Yet tests suggest that known methods, such as first-order ACs or graph cuts, are not suitable for 3D eye contour segmentation. To fill this gap, a novel AC algorithm is in- troduced that generalises existing shortest path type schemes to second-order energies while maintaining a low computational complexity. The comparison with state-of-the-art algorithms underlines that in many cases the approach yields equally good, or better results with less user interaction. The automatic variant allows for a robust and efficient segmentation of approxi- mately circular or elliptic structures, even in noisy images with gaps in the object boundary.Finally, the proposed algorithms are tested on a 3D face database. Curvature- and texture- based segmentation algorithms are evaluated in a comparative study on lip contours. The results clearly indicate that current 2D systems can benefit from 3D information: (i) incorpo- rating the surface geometry into the active contour evolution improves the performance of the classic 2D GAC algorithm. This has been conjectured before, yet without empirical evidence; (ii) the curvature-based techniques provide more robust results than the texture-based one; (iii) the curvature-based methods deliver good results for about 50% of the faces where the texture-based method fails.The thesis advances theoretical knowledge and new applications in equal measure. The results underline the versatility of the active contour concept.
