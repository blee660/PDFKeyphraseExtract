Robust dynamic vision from a moving platform is a difficult task. To be “robust” a vision algorithm must work under many different lighting conditions and envi- ronments. “Dynamic vision” is the interpretation of the 3D distance and movement from a scene. This is substantially more difficult when the scenes are captured from a “moving platform” as there are also independent moving objects along with the movement from the scene.This thesis provides a solution to the issue of robustness by introducing the concept of residual images. These images are particularly robust to illumination changes, which make them ideal for correspondence matching. The minimum re- quirement to solve “dynamic vision from a moving platform” are binocular stereo cameras. Performing correspondence matching between sequential stereo images over time enables motion and distance estimation. There are two approaches to achieve this: the first is to integrate the information over time using pixel-wise Kalman filters, the second is to loosely couple the distance and motion estimation using two sequential stereo image pairs to obtain the scene flow. The first solution provides noise-reduced partial motion information, while the second produces 3D motion estimates. All algorithms in this thesis are detailed and supported with ex- tensive experimental evidence. The appendices of this thesis include computational improvements to achieve real-time performance, making them usable in real-life applications.
